# eBooks

eBooks are a secondary file type in WROLPi, which means that they do not yet have a dedicated module, and some features
may not yet be available.

Epub files are desired as ebooks, though some support for Mobi files is provided. Reasons why WROLPi supports Epub:

* Epub files are simple.  An Epub file is a zip file containing HTML files.
* Third-party support for reading Epubs is much more feature-rich.
* Images are files in the Epub zip.
* Device supports for Epubs is nearly ubiquitous.
* Because an Epub contains HTML files, it makes it easy to display them in a web browser.
