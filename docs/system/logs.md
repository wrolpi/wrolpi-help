# Logs

The following is a simple overview to view the logs of the [WROLPi Services](index.md#services). WROLPi logs are
gathered by `systemd`.  Logs are viewed using `journalctl`.

You can watch all the logs on your WROLPi:

```shell
journalctl -f
```

More detailed logs can be viewed:

```shell
journalctl -f -p debug
```

To view logs only from the most recent boot:

```shell
journalctl -f -b
```

The above commands use `-f` (follow) which will display logs as soon as they are created.  You can view older logs by
removing `-f` from the command, but you will need to use your keyboard to navigate the logs.  Use `up`, `down`,
`page-up` and `page-down` keys.  You can also use `g` to navigate to the top of the log, and `shift-g` to navigate to
the bottom of the logs.
